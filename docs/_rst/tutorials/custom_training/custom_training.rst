In this example, we will learn how to use FastVPINNs to train on a custom PDE problem. Here we will learn
- How to setup boundary conditions for a problem
- How to generate Internal mesh
- Understanding the Tensor based loss computation structure of FastVPINNs
- How to write loss functions for custom PDEs using weak formulation.
